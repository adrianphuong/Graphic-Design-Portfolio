            <h2>How can I determine the cost of my logo?</h2>
            <p>The price of the logo depends on the <span>complexity</span> and the <span>time in which you need it completed.</span> No I do not do same day delivery or 1 day delivery unless compensated fairly.</p>
            <h2>What I should I prepare before I contact you?</h2>

            <h2>Is that all?</h2>
